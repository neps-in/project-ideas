## Features of a Simple Static Site Generator

1. **Static HTML Generation**
   Converts content files into plain HTML pages that are ready to be served by any web server.

2. **Markdown Support**
   Allows writing content using Markdown, making it easy to format text without writing HTML.

3. **Template System**
   Uses templates to apply a consistent layout (header, footer, navigation) across all pages.

4. **Separation of Content and Design**
   Content is stored separately from layout and styling, improving maintainability.

5. **Fast Page Load Times**
   Pages are pre-built, so no processing is required when a user visits the site.

6. **No Database Requirement**
   Works without a database, reducing complexity and server dependency.

7. **Improved Security**
   Since there is no server-side logic or database, the attack surface is very small.

8. **Easy Version Control**
   Content and configuration files can be tracked using Git for easy collaboration and history tracking.

9. **Simple Project Structure**
   Uses a clean folder structure for content, templates, assets, and output files.

10. **Asset Management**
    Supports static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts.

11. **Build Command**
    Generates the entire website using a single build command.

12. **Local Development Server**
    Provides a simple local server to preview the site before deployment.

13. **Custom URLs and Permalinks**
    Allows defining clean and readable URLs for pages and posts.

14. **Reusable Components**
    Enables reuse of layout components like headers, footers, and navigation menus.

15. **Basic Configuration File**
    Uses a simple configuration file to manage site settings such as site title and base URL.

16. **Cross-Platform Support**
    Runs on different operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

17. **Easy Deployment**
    Generated files can be deployed to any static hosting service.

18. **Scalable for Small to Medium Sites**
    Works well for blogs, documentation sites, and portfolio websites.
