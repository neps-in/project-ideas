# Static Site Generator

A static site generator is a tool that helps you build a website using simple files like text or Markdown instead of a database.
You write your content once, usually in plain text, and the generator converts it into complete HTML pages.
These HTML pages are created in advance, not generated each time someone visits the site.
Because of this, static sites load very fast and are highly reliable.
They are also more secure since there is no database or server-side code to attack.
Static site generators are commonly used for blogs, documentation sites, and personal websites.
They make it easy to manage content using version control systems like Git.
You can host the generated site on simple and low-cost hosting services.
Design changes can be applied across the entire site by modifying templates.
Overall, a static site generator offers a simple, fast, and efficient way to build and maintain websites.
